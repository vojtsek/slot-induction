have it all recursively under one root
create a list of utterances in text file, run topic detection
copy topic vectors with  paste -d"&" ../data/camrest_ids ../output/model/k5.pz_d | while read line; do f=`echo $line | cut -d"&" -f1`; v=`echo $line | cut -d"&" -f2`; echo $v >> $f/topics.txt; done
cluster the intents (cluster_intents.py) and create files all/n/clustx_raw etc. with copy_clusterized.py (have to run for raw, frames and states)
to create clust0...clustn dirs use create_clusterized_dirs.sh
then submith.sh which runs induction
then augment with topics which merges the slot fillers with utterances, predicts topics and write it all to the same file
finally analyze.py sorts thecandidate frames
